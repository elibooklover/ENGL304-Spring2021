* Instructor: Hoyeol Kim
* Email Address: elibooklover@Texas A&M email
* Office Location: LAAH 549

## Course Tools
We will be using a course website, course repository, Slack, and Canvas to facilitate class activities. The course website will be used for annotating Charles Dickens's <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> with [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) and sharing course materials. The course repository will be used for submitting homework assignments and sharing files. Slack will be used for better communications for class announcements, discussions, questions, and group works. Canvas will be mainly used for turning in assignments and distributing grades.

## Textbook
* <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> by Charles Dickens (provided on the course website)

## Required Software
Students are required to use their own laptops/desktops in the classroom for course activities.
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) : Both can be installed for free. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) needs to be installed first in order to use RStudio. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is a user-friendly programming tool which is free to use.
*	[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb): a cloud-based notebook environment which is suitable for machine learning and data analysis. Colab is basically free to use with limited usages. Google accounts are required to use Colab.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/): 
* [Gephi](https://gephi.org/users/download/): an open-source network analysis and visualization software package, which is free to download.

## Course Description
Topics in Digital Research. (3-0) Credit 3. This course does not require any background in computer programming. We will cover many topics of the digital humanities, specifically research methods deployed in computational literary studies. <br>

Using computational tools based on a quantitative method is a way to examine literary texts for the journey of finding answers to critical questions based on a qualitative method. Literary texts will be centered on in this course and learning computational approaches to the humanities will be secondary. In this course, we will pursue becoming meaningful digital humanists across all fields by learning computational approaches in the humanities.

## Learning Outcomes/Course Objectives
At the end of the semester, you will be able to do the following:
*	Learn collaboration by working with other members on digital projects.
*	Grasp digital archives publicly shared in the digital humanities.
*	Be familiar with basic coding with R and Python.
*	Successfully create humanities datasets and share them with the public.
*	Visualize data and extricate the visualizations.

## Attendance and Late Paper Policy
Expectations of the English Department and the University Rules are that you complete classwork and submit all assignments in the sequence they are assigned, by the deadlines posted on Canvas. It is your responsibility to check if your assignments were submitted successfully and correctly on Canvas and the Course Repository. <b>You are also expected to attend class regularly.</b> Any student in excess of <b>two unexcused absences</b> is eligible to be reported for excessive absences; any unexcused absence over this limit will lead to the loss of three percent of your final grade per absence. <b>Being more than 5 minutes late to class is considered an absence.</b> <br>

<b>Annotations and Homework Assignments will not be accepted late.</b> For all other assignments, you will lose 10% off the final assignment grade for <u><b>every day</b></u> past the due date. The Late Paper Policy for this course follows the guidelines described in the University Student Rules, “Section 7. Attendance” (http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07). 

## Make-up Policy (Excused Absences)
You must have a University-approved excuse in order to make up a missed course activity or turn in portions of the Writing Projects without a penalty. You are responsible for providing evidence to substantiate “authorized absences.” If you must miss time in the course and its activities, it is your responsibility to inform your instructor.

## Students Needing Support Service
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White Creek complex on West Campus or call 979-845-1637. For additional information, visit [http://disability.tamu.edu](http://disability.tamu.edu).

## Academic Integrity
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.” <br>

Students are expected to be aware of the Aggie Honor Code, the specific rules on plagiarism, and the Honor Council Rules and Procedures pertaining to classroom behavior as explained at [http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu](http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu).

## Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality 
Texas A&M University and the College of Liberal Arts are committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment. Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws, University employees — including instructors — cannot maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our community. As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&M System Regulation 08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even if you do not want the disclosed information to be shared: <br>

* Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting campus.

These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In many cases, it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the [Student Counseling Service](https://scs.tamu.edu/).

Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them to be concerned at [http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu](http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu).
