<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Topics in Digital Research. (3-0) Credit 3. This course does not require any background in computer programming. We cover many topics in the digital humanities, specifically research methods deployed in computational literary studies. <br /></p>

<p>Using computational tools based on quantitative methods is a way to examine literary texts in order to find answers to critical questions based on qualitative methods. This course is centered on literary texts; learning computational approaches to the humanities is secondary. In this course, we aim to become meaningful digital humanists across all fields by learning computational approaches in the humanities.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcomescourse-objectives">Learning Outcomes/Course Objectives</h2>

<h2 id="attendance-and-late-paper-policy">Attendance and Late Paper Policy</h2>
<p>Expectations of the English Department and the University Rules are that you complete classwork and submit all assignments in the sequence they are assigned, by the deadlines posted on Canvas. It is your responsibility to check if your assignments were submitted successfully and correctly on Canvas. <b>You are also expected to attend class regularly.</b> Cameras should remain turned on during class. If your camera is not on, you will not be counted present. Any student in excess of <b>two unexcused absences</b> is eligible to be reported for excessive absences; any unexcused absence over this limit will lead to the loss of three percent of your final grade per absence. <b>Being more than 5 minutes late to class is considered an absence.</b> <br /></p>

<p><b>Annotations and Homework Assignments will not be accepted late.</b> For all other assignments, you will lose 10% off the final assignment grade for <u><b>every day</b></u> past the due date. The Late Paper Policy for this course follows the guidelines described in the University Student Rules, “Section 7. Attendance” (http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07).</p>

<h2 id="makeup-work-policy">Makeup Work Policy</h2>
<p>Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance contributes to a student’s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor. <br /></p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/">Student Rule 7</a> in its entirety for information about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines. <br /></p>

<p>Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor” (<a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/">Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1</a>). <br /></p>

<p>“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence” (<a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/">Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2</a>). <br /></p>

<p>Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student Conduct Code. (See <a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule24/">Student Rule 24</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="academic-integrity-statement-and-policy">Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h2>
<p>“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.” <br /></p>

<p>“Texas A&amp;M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” (<a href="https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules">Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20</a>).<br /></p>

<p>You can learn more about the Aggie Honor System Office Rules and Procedures, academic integrity, and your rights and responsibilities at <a href="https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/">aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="americans-with-disabilities-act-ada-policy">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy</h2>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. If you experience barriers to your education due to a disability or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Resources in the Student Services Building or at (979) 845-1637 or visit <a href="https://disability.tamu.edu/">disability.tamu.edu</a>. Disabilities may include, but are not limited to attentional, learning, mental health, sensory, physical, or chronic health conditions. All students are encouraged to discuss their disability related needs with Disability Resources and their instructors as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="title-ix-and-statement-on-limits-to-confidentiality">Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.<br /></p>

<p>With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets the following conditions (see <a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf">University Rule 08.01.01.M1</a>):<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment.</li>
  <li>The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention – including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’s goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.<br /></p>

<p>Students wishing to discuss concerns in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an appointment with <a href="https://caps.tamu.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (CAPS).<br /></p>

<p>Students can learn more about filing a report, accessing supportive resources, and navigating the Title IX investigation and resolution process on the University’s <a href="https://titleix.tamu.edu/">Title IX webpage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="statement-on-mental-health-and-wellness">Statement on Mental Health and Wellness</h2>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University recognizes that mental health and wellness are critical factors that influence a student’s academic success and overall wellbeing. Students are encouraged to engage in healthy self-care by utilizing the resources and services available from Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS). Students who need someone to talk to can call the TAMU Helpline (979-845-2700) from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. weekdays and 24 hours on weekends. 24-hour emergency help is also available through the National Suicide Prevention Hotline (800-273-8255) or at <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="covid-19-temporary-addendum">COVID-19 Temporary Addendum</h2>
<h3 id="campus-safety-measures">Campus Safety Measures</h3>
<p>To promote public safety and protect students, faculty, and staff during the coronavirus pandemic, Texas A&amp;M University has adopted policies and practices for the Spring 2021 academic term to limit virus transmission. Students must observe the following practices while participating in face-to-face courses and course-related activities (office hours, help sessions, transitioning to and between classes, study spaces, academic services, etc.):<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-monitoring—Students should follow CDC recommendations for self-monitoring. Students who have a fever or exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in class remotely if that option is available, and should not participate in face-to-face instruction.</li>
  <li>Face Coverings—<a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf">Face coverings</a> (cloth face covering, surgical mask, etc.) must be properly worn in all non-private spaces including classrooms, teaching laboratories, common spaces such as lobbies and hallways, public study spaces, libraries, academic resource and support offices, and outdoor spaces where 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to reliably maintain. Description of face coverings and additional guidance are provided in the <a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf">Face Covering policy</a> and <a href="https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> available on the <a href="https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs">Provost website</a>.</li>
  <li>Physical Distancing—Physical distancing must be maintained between students, instructors, and others in course and course-related activities.</li>
  <li>Classroom Ingress/Egress—Students must follow marked pathways for entering and exiting classrooms and other teaching spaces. Leave classrooms promptly after course activities have concluded. Do not congregate in hallways and maintain 6-foot physical distancing when waiting to enter classrooms and other instructional spaces.</li>
  <li>To attend a face-to-face class, students must properly wear an approved face covering If a student refuses to wear a face covering, the instructor should ask the student to leave and join the class remotely. If the student does not leave the class, the faculty member should report that student to the <a href="https://studentlife.tamu.edu/sco/face-covering-violations/">Student Conduct office</a> for sanctions. Additionally, the faculty member may choose to teach that day’s class remotely for all students, or dismiss the class in the case of a traditional face to face lecture.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personal-illness-and-quarantine">Personal Illness and Quarantine</h3>
<p>Students required to quarantine must participate in courses and course-related activities remotely, if that option is available, and must not attend face-to-face course activities. Students should notify their instructors of the quarantine requirement. Students under quarantine are expected to participate in courses and complete graded work unless they have symptoms that are too severe to participate in course activities.<br /></p>

<p>Students experiencing personal injury or Illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualify for an excused absence (See <a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/">Student Rule 7, Section 7.2.2</a>.) To receive an excused absence, students must comply with the documentation and notification guidelines outlined in Student Rule 7.</p>
